Plugin description
Context Im making a SPE plugin for moodle ,
in group project ocntexts students are required
to evaluate themself and their peers and gives
comments and scores
So starting off with admin

Each course should have the option to add an SPE 
activity (there could be multiple SPE instances)

Each SPE activity within a course
needs a group to be created which works
by uploading a CSV file which contains 
GroupName and student ids and group name

Then there should be form fields
to add activity name description
start , end date , Evaluation questions(2-5 likert scale)
, the questions should have a nickname option asw
Disable the other module options (if possible)
